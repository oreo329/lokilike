Hybrid Augmented Reality for Participatory Learning: The Hidden Efficacy of Multi-User Game-Based Simulation<br>(IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies)
<!--more-->

![Teasor][1]

#### Abstract
> The goal of this research is to articulate and test a new hybrid Augmented Reality (AR) environment for conceptual understanding. From the theoretical lens of embodied interaction, we have designed a multi-user participatory simulation called ARfract where visitors in a science museum can learn about complex scientific concepts on the refraction of light through full-body immersion using optical see-through AR glasses, projection-based AR, and gesture technology. 

>In particular, we developed two different types of simulations for ARfract, namely a game-based simulation and a non-game simulation to explore how the order of different AR simulations influences the perceived usability, user behaviors, learning experiences, and learning outcomes. For the experiment, 10 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: 1) the game-to-non-game condition and 2) the non-game-to-game condition. The results indicate that the learners who experienced the game-based simulation before the non-game simulation performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience order. This paper also reports the usability, user behaviors, and learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid AR technologies. 

>The major contribution of this proof-of-concept research is that it articulates our understanding of how particular configurations (i.e., order) of the emerging technologies (i.e., hybrid Augmented Reality systems) and its use can lead to different learning outcomes.

#### Conclusion
> The major contribution of this research is proof-of concept and implementation of a new simulation-based learning environment using hybrid AR technologies. The wearable visualization that enables embodied interaction with visual objects exemplifies how the affordances of wearable technologies could support meaningful learning of complex science phenomena in informal learning settings. In this paper, we also suggested some design and technical challenges in hybrid AR technologies that future research needs to further examine. AR technologies supporting gesture-based interaction with multiple users, for example, need to be designed to support a strong congruency between action and concepts being learned.

> In future studies, we will explore pedagogical and technological designs of the mixed reality exhibit in context, detail the effect of the design features, and unpack how visitors are engaged with this simulation through an in-depth analysis of observed interaction and discourse.
