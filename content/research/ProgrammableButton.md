#### Abstract
> Physical buttons provide clear haptic feedback when pressed and released, but their responses are unvarying. Physical buttons can be powered by force actuators to produce unlimited click sensations, but the cost is substantial. 

> An alternative can be augmenting physical buttons with simple and inexpensive vibration actuators. When pushed, an augmented button generates
a vibration overlayed on the buttonâ€™s original kinesthetic
response, under the general framework of haptic augmented
reality. 

> We explore the design space of augmented buttons
while changing vibration frequency, amplitude, duration, and
envelope. We then visualize the perceptual structure of augmented
buttons by estimating a perceptual space for 7 physical
buttons and 40 augmented buttons. Their sensations are also
assessed against adjectives, and results are mapped into the
perceptual space to identify meaningful perceptual dimensions.
Our results contribute to understanding the benefits and limitations
of programmable vibration-augmented physical buttons
with emphasis on their feels.

#### Conclusion
This paper has explored a design space of a haptic augmentation technique that enables modulation of the feel of a real physical button by providing vibrotactile feedback. For a demonstration of the concept, we designed a large number of augmented buttons for one base physical button by varying the frequency, amplitude, envelope, and duration of vibration. Two user experiments were conducted, and their results offer the 2D perceptual space and two primary perceptual dimensions that quantify the perceptual effects of vibrotactile button augmentation in a metric space. Design guidelines for
effective button augmentation are also summarized.
