Realistic Haptic Rendering of Collision Effects Using Multimodal Vibrotactile and Impact Feedback<br> (IEEE World Haptics 2019)
<!--more-->

![HW][2]

#### Abstract
> This paper addresses the potential benefits of multimodal haptic feedback combining vibrotactile and impact stimuli for the target domain of virtual collision simulation. In this hybrid approach, we complement the limitation of each modality with the advantage of the other modality. We present the design of a hybrid device including both vibration and impact actuators and a physics-based rendering method for realistic collision simulation. We also report a user study carried out to comparatively assess the subjective quality of haptic collision rendering using vibration only, impact only, and multimodal (vibration + impact) stimuli. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal approach can contribute to critically expanding the dynamic range of virtual collision simulation, especially between highly stiff objects.

#### Conclusion
>In this paper, we have addressed the idea of combining vibrotactile and impact feedback to improve the realism of virtual contact represented by haptic stimuli. A design of simple hardware for such multimodal feedback is presented, as well as the software based on a physics engine for the rendering of realistic collisions. We also report the methods and results of a user study comparing the perceptual qualities of three different types of haptic feedback: vibration only, impact only, and multimodal. Experimental results advocate the use of impact feedback in conjunction with more popular vibrotactile feedback; it can fundamentally enlarge the class of the virtual objects whose contact sensations can be rendered with high realism. For future work, we consider sophisticating our multimodal rendering hardware and software and then applying it to the handheld controllers for HMDs.
