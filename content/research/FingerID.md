#### Abstract
> As computing paradigms shift toward mobile and ubiquitous interaction, there is an increasing demand for wearable interfaces supporting multifaceted input in smart living environments. In this regard, we introduce a system that identifies contact fingers using vibration as a modality of communication.

> We investigate the vibration characteristics of the communication channels involved and simulate the transmission of vibration sequences. In the simulation, we test and refine modulation and demodulation methods to design vibratory communication protocols that are robust to environmental noises and can detect multiple simultaneous contact fingers. As a result, we encode an on-off keying sequence with a unique carrier frequency to each finger and demodulate the sequences by applying cross-correlation.

> The main contribution of our study include the proposal of a
system and protocol for contact finger identification with specialpurpose vibratory communication. The use of vibration enables cost-effective communication between a user and a device.
