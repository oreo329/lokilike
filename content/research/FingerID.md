#### Abstract
> We explore the possibility of an input sensing method that recognizes contact fingers on rigid surfaces in this research. The limited input vocabulary is one of the key obstacles that hinder the usage of tangible interfaces. To increase the input bandwidth of tangible interaction, we suggest a sensing technique that recognizes contact finger(s) by using a wireless microphone and vibrotactile rings. We envision interaction that touch input can be anywhere as wanted.
